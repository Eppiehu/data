`standard.h5` is the baseline model for air and water, `materials1.h5`, `materials2.h5`, and `materials3.h5` are the models trained on the basis of the baseline model after changing material types. `thick1.h5`, `thick2.h5`, and `thick3.h5` are the models trained on the basis of the baseline model after changing material thickness. `test1.py` to `test9.py` are the codes related to the research, and `train.py` and `train2.py` are the model training codes.
